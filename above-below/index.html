		<h1>How is looking <br>at something like <br>the earth<br> from above <br>a fantasy?</h1>

		<p id="first">
		Looking at something that is bigger than anyone of us can phathom is a fantasy. The world makes up so much life and seeing it from an outside perspective is different, yet magnificent. When seen from above all the little things in life that we see everyday are lost in the world and it doesn't matter in the gran scheme of things. The earth is our home and when see from above, our home is a fantasy, a beautiful planet that hold a billion lives that orbits in vast space.

		<p id="second">
			I appreciate the perspective that was taken on the word <span class="fantasy">fantasy.</span>
			<br> 
			It reminds me of the American astronaut who ventured into space and when looking back at the world, realized how trivial all of the petty conflicts and borders - socioculturally and mapped - are in the grand sense of the universe. <div id="remarkable">It's remarkable <br>that in a universe<br> of infinites,</div> we are even here at all. So it should be treated as a fantasy.

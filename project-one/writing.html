    <h1>
      SPEAK THE TRUTH
    </h1>
    <p>
      Project description: "Now is the Time" to speak the truth. Nowadays, no one knows what to believe in the world. Especially when on every news platform of social media, fake news is being displayed in a way that makes it seem very real. My project is going to show these fake stories through animation and give awareness to everyone to not tell lies or spread these fake news stories. It is also going to include fun graphics and sounds because I can picture this as an ad that tries to appeal to a younger audience, because the youth is more naïve, and to spread awareness. Other people’s opinions, as well, can influence someone’s decisions in life and these influences should be based off real things. A lot of the time something is said or heard that is false and it is repeated and causes problems. Now is the time to share the truth to help influence people to make good decisions and build a positive world.

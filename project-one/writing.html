      SPEAK THE TRUTH
    </h1>

      Project description:
      "Now is the Time" to speak the truth. Nowadays, no one knows what to believe in the world. Especially when on every news platform of social media, fake news is being displayed. My project is going to show these fake stories through animation and give awareness to everyone to not tell lies or spread these fake news stories.
